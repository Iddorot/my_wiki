## Intro:
Configuration management is the process of handling changes to a system in a way that assures integrity over time, typically involving tools and processes that facilitate automation and observability.
"Make sure a system's state matches the state described by a set of proviosning scripts"

## Benefits of using Configuration Management Tool
Same benefits of using IaC - version control, Idempotent behaiovr, sharing scripting, streamline process.
+Configuration management offer a way to control multiple serves from cenralized location.

## Ansible
- Modern-Minimal tool of setting uo and maintaining remote servers, playbooks (scripts) are written in YAML.
- Ansible communicates with nodes using SSH, no need extra installation.
- Before each proviosioning the system keeps the Desired State.
- You can use variables, conditions and loops.
- Ansible collecet info from the managed nodes - *System facts* , the facts can be usedf in a playbook.
- Templates - uses Python templating system, to allow dynamic expressions and access to variables.
- Support for Extensions and Modules 

### Ansible Concepts
#### Control Node
A system where Ansible is installed and set up to connect to the servers, can't be installed on Windows.
#### Managed Nodes
The system you actually control - Must be reachable via SSH, Python >= 2.6 || Python >= 3.5.
Ansible supports a variety of operating systems including Windows servers as managed nodes.
#### Inventory
An inventory file contains a list of the hosts youâ€™ll manage using Ansible. 
Static inventories are usually created as .ini files, 
but you can also use dynamically generated inventories written in any programming language able to return JSON.
#### Tasks
An individual unit of work to execute on managed node, each action is a task, can be one-off action via ad-hoc commands or in the playbook.
#### Playbook
A playbook contains an ordered list of tasks, and a few other directives to indicate which hosts are the target of that automation, whether or not to use a privilege escalation system to run those tasks, and optional sections to define variables or include files. Ansible executes tasks sequentially, and a full playbook execution is called a play. Playbooks are written in YAML format.
#### Handlers
Handlers are used to perform actions on a service. Handlers are typically triggered by tasks, and their execution happens at the end of a play, after all tasks are finished.
It is also possible to force immediate handler execution if that is required by a task.
 #### Roles:
 A role is a set of playbooks and related files organized into a predefined structure that is known by Ansible. Roles facilitate reusing and repurposing playbooks into shareable packages of granular automation for specific goals, such as installing a web server, installing a PHP environment, or setting up a MySQL server.
